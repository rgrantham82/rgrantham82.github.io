  <h2>My Process</h2>
  <p>
    My calligraphy is more than just art—it's a statement of resilience and resourcefulness. Working with 
    cardboard as my canvas, I breathe new life into this often discarded material. Every piece carries the texture of the streets, reflecting the challenges and creativity that come from creating art while navigating life's uncertainties. 
    Using simple tools, found materials, and a mindset that embraces both chaos and beauty, I turn what’s seen as ordinary into something extraordinary.
  </p>
  <p>
    Cardboard, with its raw texture and natural imperfections, is my primary medium. It absorbs ink in a way that creates depth and unique contrasts. 
    The materials I use—sharpie markers, acrylic paints, and fountain pens—are chosen for their accessibility and their ability to leave a lasting mark, both figuratively and literally.
