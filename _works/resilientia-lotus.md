A lotus is a cliché until you paint it like a statement. Here it’s not ‘peaceful,’ it’s stubborn—a living thing that rises through muck and still opens clean. The gold ground borrows from icon tradition, not as cosplay, but as a way of saying: this matters enough to be framed like devotion.

The calligraphy is intentional counterpoint: Copperplate as breath, Blackletter as backbone.
