This piece leans into what cardboard does best: honest texture, unpretentious presence, and a street-born attitude. The flourish isn’t ‘fancy’ for its own sake—it’s a way of saying the relationship is worth the effort.

If you want something like this for your own people, I can customize names, a phrase, or an inside joke without losing the punch.
