If ‘sustainability’ is going to mean anything, it has to show up in the materials, not just the caption. This is calligraphy that doesn’t pretend the substrate is invisible. The cardboard stays loud, and that’s the charm.

Ideal for commissions where the message and the medium should agree with each other.
