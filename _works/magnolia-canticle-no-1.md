The Magnolia Canticle series treats the magnolia as both emblem and witness—a flower that reads like home, memory, and endurance all at once. In No. 1, the gesture shifts between bloom and scar, between ornament and record.

I’m interested in the moment abstraction turns into something personal: not a literal picture, but a recognizable atmosphere—like humidity, like hymn-sound, like a story you’ve lived.
