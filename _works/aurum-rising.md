Aurum Rising is built around a simple proposition: darkness isn’t a void, it’s a surface—and surfaces can be split. The gold line reads like a fissure, a breach, or a passage. I let the matte black act as a kind of silence so the metallic light can behave like light, not decoration.

Collectors sometimes see a whale breaching in the arcs—an accidental revelation I now gladly accept. It’s the sort of visual ‘truth’ you don’t plan; it arrives like weather.
