      <h2>Welcome to My Calligraphy Gallery</h2>
      <p>I'm Robert, a street artist based in Austin, Texas, channeling resilience and personal narrative through expressive calligraphy on unconventional canvases—mostly cardboard. Each piece is a moment, a message, and a mirror reflecting both tradition and rebellion.</p>

      <h3>AI as a Creative Companion</h3>
      <p>At <em>Cardboard Calligraphy by Robert</em>, I use AI primarily as a source of inspiration and assistance throughout the creative process. From conceptualizing initial designs to refining intricate details, AI helps me explore new artistic possibilities while maintaining the authenticity of my handmade work. This technology supports my vision without replacing the human touch—every piece is carefully crafted and uniquely mine. By integrating AI into my workflow, I also protect my original designs, making them more distinctive and challenging to replicate. Each composition is a personal expression, blending traditional calligraphy with modern innovation to deliver authentic and one-of-a-kind artwork.</p>
