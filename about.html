<section class="about">
    <p>Hello, I’m Robert, a dedicated calligraphy artist living and creating in Austin, TX. My path into this art form has been anything but typical, shaped by personal challenges, a deep love for history and the written word, and a commitment to sustainability. While I’m currently experiencing homelessness, I’ve chosen not to let my circumstances limit my creativity or my drive to share beauty with the world. In fact, it has prompted me to embrace unconventional materials—most notably, recycled cardboard—transforming what many view as disposable into canvases for elegant, flowing script.</p>

    <p>My background is diverse and has informed the way I think about art and communication. I hold a bachelor’s degree in history from the University of Southern Mississippi, earned in 2009. Studying narratives, cultures, and literature across time and place taught me to see language as art, not merely information. This perspective guides my pen and brush strokes, as I blend the aesthetics of written language with the depth of its meaning.</p>

    <p>Over the years, I’ve explored various paths, each contributing to my artistic practice. I’m a first-degree black belt in Aikido, and the principles of balance, harmony, and focus I’ve learned through martial arts naturally inform the measured grace of my calligraphy. I also speak German as a second language, an experience that broadened my understanding of how words shape thought, culture, and identity. More recently, I’ve dedicated three years to training as a data analyst, honing my attention to detail, pattern recognition, and precision—qualities that shine through in the meticulous spacing and delicate forms of my letterwork.</p>

    <p>As someone on the autism spectrum, I bring a unique lens to the creative process. My heightened sensitivity to texture, shape, and rhythm influences the materials I select and the compositions I create. My autism also encourages me to approach each project with authenticity and care, highlighting that art can emerge from any circumstance, given patience and an open mind. With ink and cardboard, I demonstrate that creativity knows no bounds and that true artistry can thrive outside of conventional settings.</p>

    <p>Through my calligraphy, I aim to raise awareness about sustainability and the value of repurposing resources. Beauty can blossom from what we discard; a simple piece of cardboard can become a meaningful work of art. Each piece I produce testifies to the idea that storytelling, history, and environmental consciousness can merge into something both visually captivating and thought-provoking. My work encourages others to appreciate the overlooked, to find inspiration in everyday materials, and to value the subtle dance of letters on a page.</p>

    <p>Thank you for taking the time to learn about my journey. Your interest not only supports my growth as an artist but also helps illuminate broader issues—environmental stewardship, accessibility, and the power of creativity to uplift. I hope my calligraphy inspires you to look at the world with fresh eyes, to cherish the quiet power of words, and to recognize that art can connect us across boundaries, time, and place.</p>
