  <h1>About Robert</h1>
  <p>
    I’m a modern expressive calligrapher and painter based in Austin, Texas. My practice
    fuses Copperplate and Blackletter/Fraktur with abstract fields, scumbles, and
    gestural mark‑making. The work is a ledger of resilience—hope written in the hand,
    layered across surfaces from gessobord to found cardboard.
  </p>
  <p>
    I also wear a data‑analyst hat. I build tidy pipelines in Python and SQL, and
    I design dashboards that help creative businesses make sharper decisions. My BA in
    History (University of Southern Mississippi, 2009) keeps me honest about sources,
    context, and craft.
