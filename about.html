    <p>
      Austin‑based calligrapher and painter blending Copperplate & Blackletter with
      contemporary abstraction. Work centers on hope, resilience, and memory—
      handwritten lines woven into layered paint.

    <h2 id="artist-statement">Artist Statement</h2>
    <p>
      I work where disciplined letterforms meet gestural paint. My practice grew out of
      years of studying traditional scripts—especially <em>Copperplate</em> and <em>Blackletter</em>—
      and pushing them into contemporary contexts: layered grounds, veils of glaze,
      scumbled textures, and palimpsests of text. The pieces often surface words like
      <em>misericordia</em>, <em>virtus</em>, and <em>resilientia</em>—not as slogans, but as anchors for
      grief, courage, and care. I call the studio ethos “hope, written by hand.”
    </p><h2 id="materials-process">Materials & Process</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Surfaces:</strong> Ampersand Gessobord (7/8" cradle), canvas, and reclaimed cardboard.</li>
  <li><strong>Media:</strong> Acrylics (with glazes & scumbles), occasional tempera and mixed media markers.</li>
  <li><strong>Lettering:</strong> Copperplate, Blackletter, and calligraffiti hybrids built on sacred‑geometry grids.</li>
  <li><strong>Palette:</strong> Deep blues, bone whites, metallic accents, and quiet neutrals that read like aged plaster.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="themes">Themes</h2>
<p>
  Much of my work wrestles with resilience—personal and communal—while tracking
  the marks of time. Magnolia motifs, Latin mottos, and German phrases recur as
  talismans. I’m interested in how handwriting—our most human mark—carries memory
  across surfaces and years.
</p>

<h2 id="commissions">Commissions</h2>
<p>
  I take a limited number of commissions each month—ranging from compact
  calligraphy studies to larger statement works on Gessobord. If you have a word,
  text, or concept that matters to you, I’ll develop a layered design with sketches,
  script studies, and a materials plan. Student and community discounts are
  available when possible.
</p>
