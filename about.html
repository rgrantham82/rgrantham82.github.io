      <h2>My Journey</h2>
      <p>
        My name is Robert, and I’m a calligrapher who has turned the streets into my studio. As someone who has experienced the challenges of being unhoused, I’ve found beauty and purpose in unexpected places. Using recycled cardboard as my canvas, I blend traditional calligraphy techniques with graffiti-inspired styles to tell stories of resilience, creativity, and sustainability.
      </p>

      <h2>Why Cardboard?</h2>
      <p>
        Cardboard is more than a material; it’s a symbol of transformation. It represents the overlooked, the discarded, and the underappreciated. By reclaiming it, I not only reduce waste but also breathe life into something forgotten, transforming it into art that inspires and connects.
      </p>

      <h2>Art with a Purpose</h2>
      <p>
        My art isn’t just about aesthetics—it’s about advocacy. It raises awareness about sustainability, resilience, and the realities of being unhoused. Every piece carries a message, whether it’s a word of encouragement, a story of struggle, or a celebration of hope.
