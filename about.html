      <p>
        Hello, I’m Robert, a dedicated calligraphy artist living and creating in
        Austin, TX. My journey into this art form has been anything but typical,
        shaped by personal challenges, a deep love for history and the written
        word, and a commitment to sustainability. Despite my current hardships,
        I refuse to let circumstances limit my creativity. Instead, they inspire
        me to transform unconventional materials—most notably, recycled cardboard—
        into canvases that reveal beauty through elegant, flowing script.

      <h2>Rooted in Authenticity</h2>
      <p>
        I create my work on reclaimed cardboard, turning this humble medium into
        a canvas for expression. This choice reflects my commitment to sustainability
        and resourcefulness, embodying the raw, unpolished beauty found in everyday
        materials.

      <p>
        With a background in history and data analysis, I bring a deep appreciation
        for storytelling into my art. Every piece carries meaning—whether it’s about
        empowerment, gratitude, or hope—making my work more than just decorative;
        it’s a way to communicate profound truths and connect with others.

      <h2>Modern Expressive Calligraphy</h2>
      <p>
        My personal style is defined by a unique fusion of traditional calligraphic
        techniques and contemporary design. I draw inspiration from classical scripts
        like Fraktur and Antiqua, yet I push these time-honored forms into a modern
        realm through fluid, expressive strokes, balanced precision, and an innovative
        play with negative space.

      <h2>Empowerment Through Art</h2>
      <p>
        Through uplifting messages and intentional designs, I aim to inspire strength
        and authenticity in others. My work often focuses on themes of inner strength,
        gratitude, and personal growth, leaving a positive impact on all who encounter it.

      <h2>A Diverse Background</h2>
      <p>
        I hold a bachelor’s degree in history from the University of Southern Mississippi
        (2009). Studying narratives, cultures, and literature across time taught me to
        see language as art, not merely information.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a first-degree black belt in Aikido, the principles of balance, harmony, and
        focus naturally inform the measured grace of my calligraphy. Speaking German as
        a second language has broadened my understanding of how words shape thought,
        culture, and identity.

    <div class="about-text">
      <h2>Connection to Aikido</h2>
      <p>
        As a practitioner of Aikido, I bring harmony and flow into my creative process.
        The discipline and balance inherent in martial arts influence the rhythm and
        energy of my strokes, creating pieces that feel both deliberate and natural.

      <h2>Urban Renaissance</h2>
      <p>
        I view my art as part of a modern urban renaissance—elevating overlooked materials
        and turning them into something beautiful and meaningful. This transformation
        reflects not only my work but also my own journey, celebrating resilience, creativity,
        and the ever-evolving nature of art.
