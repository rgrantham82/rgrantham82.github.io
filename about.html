        <p>
          Hello, I’m Robert, a dedicated calligraphy artist living and creating in Austin, TX. My journey into this art form has been anything but typical, shaped by personal challenges, a deep love for history and the written word, and a commitment to sustainability. Despite my current hardships, I refuse to let circumstances limit my creativity. Instead, they inspire me to transform unconventional materials—most notably, recycled cardboard—into canvases that reveal beauty through elegant, flowing script.

      <div class="text">
        <h2>Rooted in Authenticity</h2>
        <p>
          I create my work on reclaimed cardboard, turning this humble medium into a canvas for expression. This choice reflects my commitment to sustainability and resourcefulness, embodying the raw, unpolished beauty found in everyday materials.

      <div class="text">
        <h2>A Storyteller at Heart</h2>
        <p>
          With a background in history and data analysis, I bring a deep appreciation for storytelling into my art. Every piece carries meaning—whether it’s about empowerment, gratitude, or hope—making my work more than just decorative; it’s a way to communicate profound truths and connect with others.

    <!-- Section 4: Modern Expressive Calligraphy -->
    <div class="about-section">

      <div class="text">
        <h2>Modern Expressive Calligraphy</h2>
        <p>
          My personal style is defined by a unique fusion of traditional calligraphic techniques and contemporary design. I draw inspiration from classical scripts like Fraktur and Antiqua, yet I push these time-honored forms into a modern realm through fluid, expressive strokes, balanced precision, and an innovative play with negative space. This synthesis creates a visual language that is both structured and dynamically spontaneous—a true reflection of modern expressive calligraphy.

    <!-- Section 5: Empowerment Through Art -->

      <div class="text">
        <h2>Empowerment Through Art</h2>
        <p>
          Through uplifting messages and intentional designs, I aim to inspire strength and authenticity in others. My work often focuses on themes of inner strength, gratitude, and personal growth, leaving a positive impact on all who encounter it.

    <!-- Section 6: A Diverse Background -->
    <div class="about-section">
      <img src="/assets/images/th.jpg" alt="Aikido Inspired Art">
      <div class="text">
        <h2>A Diverse Background</h2>
        <p>
          My diverse experiences have informed the way I think about art and communication. I hold a bachelor’s degree in history from the University of Southern Mississippi, earned in 2009. Studying narratives, cultures, and literature across time taught me to see language as art, not merely information.
        </p>
        <p>
          Over the years, I’ve explored various paths, each contributing to my artistic practice. As a first-degree black belt in Aikido, the principles of balance, harmony, and focus naturally inform the measured grace of my calligraphy. Speaking German as a second language has broadened my understanding of how words shape thought, culture, and identity.

      <div class="text">
        <h2>Connection to Aikido</h2>
        <p>
          As a practitioner of Aikido, I bring harmony and flow into my creative process. The discipline and balance inherent in martial arts influence the rhythm and energy of my strokes, creating pieces that feel both deliberate and natural.

      <div class="text">
        <h2>Urban Renaissance</h2>
        <p>
          I view my art as part of a modern urban renaissance—elevating overlooked materials and turning them into something beautiful and meaningful. This transformation reflects not only my work but also my own journey, celebrating resilience, creativity, and the ever-evolving nature of art.
