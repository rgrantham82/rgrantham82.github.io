# Data Integrity and Optimization Project

## Project Overview

This project aims to ensure the integrity and optimization of the Austin Police Department's crime reports data. By utilizing data cleaning and optimization techniques, the project addresses inconsistencies and prepares the data for effective analysis. The data is accessed via the API endpoint: https://data.austintexas.gov/resource/fdj4-gpfu.csv.

## Data Description

### AUSTIN POLICE DEPARTMENT DATA DISCLAIMER

Please read and understand the following information.

This dataset contains a record of incidents that the Austin Police Department responded to and wrote a report. Please note one incident may have several offenses associated with it, but this dataset only depicts the highest level offense of that incident. Data is from 2003 to present. This dataset is updated weekly. Understanding the following conditions will allow you to get the most out of the data provided. Due to the methodological differences in data collection, different data sources may produce different results. This database is updated weekly, and a similar or same search done on different dates can produce different results. Comparisons should not be made between numbers generated with this database to any other official police reports. Data provided represents only calls for police service where a report was written. Totals in the database may vary considerably from official totals following investigation and final categorization. Therefore, the data should not be used for comparisons with Uniform Crime Report statistics. The Austin Police Department does not assume any liability for any decision made or action taken or not taken by the recipient in reliance upon any information or data provided.
